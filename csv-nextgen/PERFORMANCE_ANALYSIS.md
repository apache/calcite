- **Engine**: Linq4j (row-based processing)
- **Batch Size**: 1024 rows
- **Test Date**: July 2025

## Performance Test Results

### Data Generation Performance
The adapter shows excellent data generation capabilities:
- **10K rows**: 144,928 rows/sec (0.82 MB)
- **50K rows**: 273,224 rows/sec (4.13 MB)
- **100K rows**: 555,556 rows/sec (8.27 MB)
- **500K rows**: 568,828 rows/sec (41.77 MB)

### Query Performance by Operation Type

#### 1. Full Table Scans (COUNT operations)
- **10K rows**: 34 ms → 29 count/sec
- **50K rows**: 25 ms → 40 count/sec
- **100K rows**: 38 ms → 26 count/sec
- **500K rows**: 186 ms → 5 count/sec

**Analysis**: COUNT operations show good scalability up to 100K rows, with linear degradation at 500K rows.

#### 2. Data Projection Performance
| Dataset | 3 Columns | 10 Columns (Full) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| 10K     | 714.3K rows/sec | 555.6K rows/sec |
| 50K     | 2.08M rows/sec | 1.79M rows/sec |
| 100K    | 2.38M rows/sec | 2.08M rows/sec |
| 500K    | 2.59M rows/sec | 2.26M rows/sec |

**Analysis**:
- Excellent projection performance scaling nearly linearly
- 3-column projections are 15-20% faster than full projections
- Peak performance of **2.59M rows/sec** achieved at 500K row dataset
- Performance improves with larger datasets due to better amortization

#### 3. Filtering Performance
| Dataset | Price Filter | Category Filter | Complex Filter |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 10K     | 47 filters/sec | 62 filters/sec | 45 filters/sec |
| 50K     | 33 filters/sec | 35 filters/sec | 24 filters/sec |
| 100K    | 19 filters/sec | 23 filters/sec | 18 filters/sec |
| 500K    | 4 filters/sec  | 5 filters/sec  | 4 filters/sec  |

**Analysis**:
- Filtering shows inverse relationship with dataset size
- Simple filters (category = 'Electronics') perform better than numeric range filters
- Complex multi-condition filters have 20-40% performance penalty

#### 4. Aggregation Performance
| Dataset | GROUP BY category | GROUP BY region + agg |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 10K     | 416 groups/sec   | 285 groups/sec       |
| 50K     | 208 groups/sec   | 122 groups/sec       |
| 100K    | 125 groups/sec   | 96 groups/sec        |
| 500K    | 24 groups/sec    | 22 groups/sec        |

**Analysis**:
- GROUP BY performance degrades with dataset size
- Multi-aggregate queries (AVG, SUM) have ~30% performance impact
- Small result sets (5-6 groups) maintain reasonable performance

#### 5. Sorting Performance
| Dataset | ORDER BY LIMIT 1000 |
|---------|---------------------|
| 10K     | 55.6K rows/sec     |
| 50K     | 21.3K rows/sec     |
| 100K    | 6.6K rows/sec      |
| 500K    | 1.5K rows/sec      |

**Analysis**:
- Sorting shows significant performance degradation with scale
- O(n log n) complexity clearly visible
- LIMIT clause helps but doesn't eliminate sorting overhead

#### 6. Complex Analytical Queries
| Dataset | Performance |
|---------|-------------|
| 10K     | 1.1K queries/sec |
| 50K     | 697 queries/sec  |
| 100K    | 357 queries/sec  |
| 500K    | 105 queries/sec  |

**Analysis**:
- Complex queries combining WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
- Performance degrades exponentially with dataset size
- Still maintains reasonable performance for analytical workloads

### Throughput Analysis

#### Data Processing Throughput
- **10K rows**: 83.46 MB/sec
- **50K rows**: 133.52 MB/sec
- **100K rows**: 133.52 MB/sec
- **500K rows**: 121.38 MB/sec

**Analysis**:
- Peak throughput of **133.52 MB/sec** achieved at 50K-100K row datasets
- Slight degradation at very large datasets (500K+)
- Excellent sustained throughput for medium-large datasets
