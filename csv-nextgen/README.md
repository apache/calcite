# CSV NextGen Adapter

The CSV NextGen adapter provides high-performance CSV and TSV processing for Apache Calcite with pluggable execution engines optimized for different workload types.

## Features

### Execution Engines

1. **LINQ4J** - Traditional row-by-row processing
   - Best for: OLTP workloads, small datasets, row-wise operations
   - Performance: Standard Calcite enumerable performance

2. **ARROW** - Arrow-based columnar processing
   - Best for: Medium datasets, mixed workloads, filtering operations
   - Performance: Competitive across all operations, excels at filtering

3. **VECTORIZED** (Default) - Optimized vectorized Arrow processing
   - Best for: OLAP workloads, large datasets, analytical queries
   - Performance: 1.2-2.6x faster than LINQ4J, with benefits scaling with dataset size

ðŸ“Š **[View Detailed Performance Results](PERFORMANCE_RESULTS.md)** - Comprehensive benchmarks across 100K-1M row datasets

### Key Optimizations

- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes (default: 2048 rows)
- **Columnar Access**: Cache-friendly memory access patterns
- **Vectorized Operations**: SIMD-style chunked processing for aggregations and filtering
- **Zero-Copy Projection**: Direct vector manipulation without row materialization
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically scans directories for CSV/TSV files

## Configuration

### Basic Model.json

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultSchema": "csvnextgen",
  "schemas": [
    {
      "name": "csvnextgen",
      "type": "custom",
      "factory": "org.apache.calcite.adapter.csvnextgen.CsvNextGenSchemaFactory",
      "operand": {
        "directory": "data/",
        "executionEngine": "vectorized",
        "batchSize": 2048
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `directory` | String | Required* | Base directory containing CSV files |
| `file` | String | Optional | Single CSV file path (alternative to directory) |
| `tableName` | String | Optional | Table name when using single file (default: filename without extension) |
| `executionEngine` | String | `"vectorized"` | Engine type: `"linq4j"`, `"arrow"`, or `"vectorized"` |
| `batchSize` | Integer | `2048` | Number of rows per batch for columnar engines |
| `tables` | Array | Optional | Explicit table definitions |

*Either `directory` or `file` is required

### Single File Configuration

For scenarios where you want to work with a single CSV file instead of a directory:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultSchema": "my_data",
  "schemas": [
    {
      "name": "my_data",
      "type": "custom",
      "factory": "org.apache.calcite.adapter.csvnextgen.CsvNextGenSchemaFactory",
      "operand": {
        "file": "data/sales.csv",
        "tableName": "sales_data",
        "executionEngine": "vectorized"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Features:**
- `file`: Path to a single CSV/TSV file (supports .csv, .tsv, .csv.gz, .tsv.gz)
- `tableName`: Optional custom table name (defaults to filename without extension)
- Uses the same execution engines and performance optimizations as directory mode
- Supports relative and absolute file paths

**Example with auto-generated table name:**
```json
{
  "operand": {
    "file": "reports/quarterly_results.csv",
    "executionEngine": "vectorized"
  }
}
```
This creates a table named `QUARTERLY_RESULTS` from the file `quarterly_results.csv`.

### Explicit Table Configuration

```json
{
  "operand": {
    "directory": "data/",
    "executionEngine": "vectorized",
    "tables": [
      {
        "name": "sales",
        "file": "sales.csv",
        "header": true
      },
      {
        "name": "products",
        "file": "products.tsv",
        "header": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Multiple Schemas with Different Engines

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "name": "oltp_data",
      "type": "custom",
      "factory": "org.apache.calcite.adapter.csvnextgen.CsvNextGenSchemaFactory",
      "operand": {
        "directory": "transactional/",
        "executionEngine": "linq4j"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "analytics_data",
      "type": "custom",
      "factory": "org.apache.calcite.adapter.csvnextgen.CsvNextGenSchemaFactory",
      "operand": {
        "directory": "warehouse/",
        "executionEngine": "vectorized",
        "batchSize": 4096
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Schema Factory Direct Usage

```java
// Create schema programmatically
Map<String, Object> operand = new HashMap<>();
operand.put("directory", "/path/to/csv/files");
operand.put("executionEngine", "vectorized");
operand.put("batchSize", 2048);

SchemaPlus rootSchema = Frameworks.createRootSchema(true);
Schema schema = CsvNextGenSchemaFactory.INSTANCE.create(rootSchema, "csv", operand);
```

### Performance Comparison Example

```sql
-- Same analytical query on different execution engines
SELECT region, SUM(revenue), AVG(profit_margin)
FROM sales
WHERE profit_margin > 15.0
GROUP BY region;
```

**Performance Results (1M rows):**
- **LINQ4J**: 842ms (baseline)
- **ARROW**: 1088ms (0.77x vs LINQ4J)
- **VECTORIZED**: 319ms (**2.64x faster** than LINQ4J)

**Key Insight**: Vectorized engine shows dramatic improvements for aggregation-heavy analytical queries.

ðŸ“ˆ **[See Full Performance Analysis](PERFORMANCE_RESULTS.md)** for detailed benchmarks across all operation types.

## File Support

- **CSV files**: `.csv`, `.csv.gz`
- **TSV files**: `.tsv`, `.tsv.gz`
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects separator (comma vs tab)
- **Headers**: Configurable header row detection
- **Compression**: Transparent gzip support
- **Recursive scanning**: Scans subdirectories automatically

## Performance Characteristics

### Vectorized Engine Benefits by Operation Type

| Operation | Performance Improvement | Best Performance At |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Projection** | Up to 1.35x faster | Large datasets (1M+ rows) |
| **Filtering** | Variable* | Small-medium datasets |
| **Aggregation** | Up to 2.64x faster | All dataset sizes |
| **COUNT Operations** | 1.04-1.23x faster | Consistent across scales |
| **MIN/MAX** | 1.06-1.12x faster | Large datasets |

*Note: Filtering performance varies by dataset size and predicate complexity

### Scaling Characteristics

- **Small datasets** (<100K rows): LINQ4J competitive, Arrow leads in projection
- **Medium datasets** (100K-500K rows): Vectorized begins showing advantages
- **Large datasets** (>1M rows): Vectorized dominates, especially for aggregations
