   * Allows you to treat a nullable type as non-nullable with no assertions.
   *
   * <p>It is useful in the case you have a nullable lately-initialized field
   * like the following:
   *
   * <pre><code>
   * class Wrapper&lt;T&gt; {
   *   &#64;Nullable T value;
   * }
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * <p>That signature allows you to use {@code Wrapper} with both nullable or
   * non-nullable types: {@code Wrapper<@Nullable Integer>}
   * vs {@code Wrapper<Integer>}. Suppose you need to implement
   *
   * <pre><code>
   * T get() { return value; }
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * <p>The issue is checkerframework does not permit that because {@code T}
   * has unknown nullability, so the following needs to be used:
   *
   * <pre><code>
   * T get() { return sneakyNull(value); }
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * @param <T>     the type of the reference
   * @param ref     a reference of @Nullable type, that is non-null at run time
   *
   * @return the argument, cast to have the type qualifier @NonNull
