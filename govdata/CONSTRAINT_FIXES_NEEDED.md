# Constraint Implementation - FINAL STATUS

## ✅ All Constraint Issues Resolved

### Summary of Final Implementation

### 1. ✅ SEC Tables - Primary Key Alignment
**Issue:** ERD showed PKs using `filing_date` but code uses `accession_number`

**Fix Applied:** 
- Updated ERD in SCHEMA_RELATIONSHIPS.md to use `accession_number` as part of primary keys
- All SEC tables now correctly show `accession_number` in their PKs
- `filing_date` moved to non-PK column in all tables

### 2. ✅ ZIP to State Foreign Keys
**Issue:** ZIP tables lacked foreign keys to states table

**Fix Applied in GeoSchemaFactory.java:**
- Added `state_fips` → `tiger_states.state_fips` FK to `hud_zip_county`
- Added `state_fips` → `tiger_states.state_fips` FK to `hud_zip_tract`  
- Added `state_fips` → `tiger_states.state_fips` FK to `hud_zip_cbsa`
- All ZIP tables now properly reference their parent state

### 3. ✅ Footnotes Relationships
**Issue:** Footnotes lacked explicit FKs to financial_line_items and xbrl_relationships

**Fix Applied:**
- Added documentation that relationships to financial_line_items and xbrl_relationships are conceptual
- These relationships use the `referenced_concept` field for JOIN queries
- Maintained FK to filing_metadata as the primary structural relationship

### 4. ✅ SEC Table Constraint Metadata
**Issue:** Several SEC tables lacked constraint metadata

**Fix Applied in SecSchemaFactory.java:**
- Added constraint metadata for `vectorized_blobs`, `mda_sections`, `xbrl_relationships`, `filing_contexts`
- All tables now have proper primary keys and foreign keys to filing_metadata
- Complete constraint coverage for all SEC tables

### 5. ✅ Cross-Schema Foreign Keys Solution
**Initial Problem:** Different state code formats (2-letter vs FIPS) seemed to prevent true FKs

**Final Solution:**
- Discovered `tiger_states` table already has BOTH columns:
  - `state_fips`: FIPS codes (e.g., "06" for California)
  - `state_code`: 2-letter codes (e.g., "CA")
- Updated cross-schema FKs to use `tiger_states.state_code`:
  - SEC: `filing_metadata.state_of_incorporation` → `geo.tiger_states.state_code`
  - ECON: `regional_employment.state_code` → `geo.tiger_states.state_code`
- No new tables needed - tiger_states serves as the natural bridge

### 6. ✅ ECON Table Constraint Metadata
**Issue:** No constraint definitions for ECON tables

**Fix Applied in EconSchemaFactory.java:**
- Added defineEconTableConstraints() method
- Defined primary keys for all ECON tables:
  - `employment_statistics`: (date, series_id)
  - `inflation_metrics`: (date, index_type, item_code, area_code)
  - `wage_growth`: (date, series_id, industry_code, occupation_code)
  - `regional_employment`: (date, area_code)
- Added cross-schema FK from regional_employment to tiger_states

## Key Insights

1. **No New Tables Required**: The existing `tiger_states` table already provides the state code mapping functionality
2. **True Cross-Schema FKs Are Possible**: Since tiger_states has both FIPS and 2-letter codes, we can have proper referential integrity
3. **ERD Now Matches Implementation**: All primary keys and foreign keys in the ERD accurately reflect the code

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test that DatabaseMetaData.getExportedKeys() returns correct FKs
2. Test that DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() returns correct PKs  
3. Verify cross-schema FKs work with multi-schema queries
4. Test constraint validation in query planning
5. Validate that JOINs between schemas use the state_code column correctly
