# In this file (due to the use of 'scott-big-query' below, and unlike typical
# Quidem tests), types are aliased to be consistent with BigQuery's type names,
# not Calcite's usual type names. # In particular:
#  * DATETIME is what Calcite calls TIMESTAMP;
#  * TIMESTAMP is what Calcite calls TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE;
#  * DATE and TIME are the same as Calcite;
#  * BYTES means VARBINARY(*);
#  * STRING means VARCHAR(*).
#
# The DATETIME() and TIMESTAMP() functions are also substituted so that they
# produce values that BigQuery would call DATETIME and TIMESTAMP.
