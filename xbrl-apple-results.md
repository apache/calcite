## Architecture Benefits

### Declarative Data Sourcing
- Model declares **what** data to fetch (Apple 10-Ks from 2019-2024)
- Adapter handles **how** to fetch and process automatically
- No imperative download/parsing code needed

### Partition Pruning Efficiency
```
Partition Structure: /cik=0000320193/filing_type=10-K/filing_date=2024-09-30/
```
- Queries with `WHERE cik = '0000320193'` skip all other companies
- Queries with `WHERE filing_type = '10-K'` skip quarterly reports
- Date range queries only scan relevant year partitions

### SQL-Based Analysis
- Standard SQL queries work across all XBRL data
- Joins between financial_line_items, footnotes, and company_info tables
- Window functions for year-over-year calculations
- Materialized views for commonly accessed metrics

This demonstrates how the declarative model approach with the XBRL adapter enables powerful financial analysis through simple SQL queries on automatically fetched and processed SEC EDGAR data.
