# HOW TO RELEASE the Looker fork of Calcite:
#
# 1. Start working off the current fork branch: https://github.com/looker-open-source/calcite/tree/looker
#    `git fetch git@github.com:looker-open-source/calcite.git looker && git checkout FETCH_HEAD`
# 2. Do whatever needs to be done (rebase on trunk, cherry-pick, remove fixups, etc.),
#    but don't bother updating the `calcite.version` line in `gradle.properties`.
#    There should only be "business logic" commits,
#    and every commit that is not yet upstreamed (called "fix-up" commits)
#    should reference a Calcite Jira ticket in its message,
#    and have a PR open to upstream it to Apache's main repo, if possible.
# 3. Once the code looks good and your Git working directory is clean, run this script
#    which will do all of this (mostly) automatically:
#    a) Pull all Looker Calcite version tags from GitHub and show you what the latest one is.
#       This is just for convenience.
#    b) Ask you what the next version number should be.
#       The major number should always be whatever's in Apache's `main` branch.
#       The minor number should probably be 1 less than whatever's in Apache's `main` branch.
#       Increment the patch number when you make backward compatible bug fixes.
#       Generally, we just increment the patch number.
#    c) Reset your local `looker` branch to the current HEAD.
#    d) Update the version line in `gradle.properties` and create a version bump commit.
#    e) Create a release tag pointing to the new version bump commit.
#    f) Provide you with the commands to push your new branch and tag to GitHub,
#       and publish release artifacts to Nexus.
#       This script only automates local changes by design; double-check everything before pushing.
