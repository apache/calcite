# This file is an FMPP (http://fmpp.sourceforge.net/) configuration file to
# allow clients to extend Calcite's SQL parser to support application specific
# SQL statements, literals or data types.
#
# Calcite's parser grammar file (Parser.jj) is written in javacc
# (http://javacc.java.net/) with Freemarker (http://freemarker.org/) variables
# to allow clients to:
#   1. have custom parser implementation class and package name.
#   2. insert new parser method implementations written in javacc to parse
#      custom:
#      a) SQL statements.
#      b) literals.
#      c) data types.
#   3. add new keywords to support custom SQL constructs added as part of (2).
#   4. add import statements needed by inserted custom parser implementations.
#
# Parser template file (Parser.jj) along with this file are packaged as
# part of the calcite-core-<version>.jar under "codegen" directory.
