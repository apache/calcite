/**
 * SargInterval represents a single contiguous search interval over a scalar
 * domain of a given datatype (including null values). It consists of two
 * endpoints: a lower bound and an upper bound, which may be the same for the
 * case of a single point. The endpoints are represented via instances of {@link
 * SargEndpoint}. An empty interval is represented by setting both bounds to be
 * open with the same value (the null value, but it doesn't really matter).
 *
 * <p>Instances of SargInterval are immutable after construction.
 *
 * <p>For string representation, we use the standard mathematical bracketed
 * bounds pair notation, with round brackets for open bounds and square brackets
 * for closed bounds, e.g.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>[3,5] represents all values between 3 and 5 inclusive
 * <li>(3,5] represents all values greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5
 * <li>[3,5) represents all values greatern than or equal to 3 and less than 5
 * <li>(3,5) represents all values between 3 and 5 exclusive
 * <li>(3,+infinity) represents all values greater than 3
 * <li>(-infinity,5] represents all values less than or equal to 5
 * <li>[5,5] represents the single point with coordinate 5
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Null values are ordered lower than any non-null value but higher than
 * -infinity. So the interval [null,7) would include the null value and any
 * non-null value less than 7.
