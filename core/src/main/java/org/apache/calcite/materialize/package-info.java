/**
 * Management of materialized query results.
 *
 * <p>An actor ({@link org.apache.calcite.materialize.MaterializationActor})
 * maintains the state of all
 * materializations in the system and is wrapped in a service
 * ({@link org.apache.calcite.materialize.MaterializationService})
 * for access from other parts of the system.</p>
 *
 * <p>Optimizer rules allow Calcite to rewrite queries using materializations,
 * if they are valid (that is, contain the same result as executing their
 * defining query) and lower cost.
 *
 * <p>In future, the actor may manage the process of updating materializations,
 * instantiating materializations from the intermediate results of queries, and
 * recognize what materializations would be useful based on actual query load.
