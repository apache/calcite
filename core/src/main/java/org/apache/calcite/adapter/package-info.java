/**
 * Calcite adapters.
 *
 * <p>An adapter allows Calcite to access data in a particular data source as
 * if it were a collection of tables in a schema. Each adapter typically
 * contains an implementation of {@link org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaFactory}
 * and some classes that implement other schema SPIs.
 *
 * <p>To use an adapter, include a custom schema in a JSON model file:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *    schemas: [
 *      {
 *        type: 'custom',
 *        name: 'My Custom Schema',
 *        factory: 'com.acme.MySchemaFactory',
 *        operand: {a: 'foo', b: [1, 3.5] }
 *      }
 *   ]
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
