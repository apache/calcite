/**
 * A namespace for tables and functions.
 *
 * <p>A schema can also contain sub-schemas, to any level of nesting. Most
 * providers have a limited number of levels; for example, most JDBC databases
 * have either one level ("schemas") or two levels ("database" and
 * "catalog").</p>
 *
 * <p>There may be multiple overloaded functions with the same name but
 * different numbers or types of parameters.
 * For this reason, {@link #getFunctions} returns a list of all
 * members with the same name. Calcite will call
 * {@link Schemas#resolve(org.apache.calcite.rel.type.RelDataTypeFactory, String, java.util.Collection, java.util.List)}
 * to choose the appropriate one.</p>
 *
 * <p>The most common and important type of member is the one with no
 * arguments and a result type that is a collection of records. This is called a
 * <dfn>relation</dfn>. It is equivalent to a table in a relational
 * database.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, the query</p>
 *
 * <blockquote>select * from sales.emps</blockquote>
 *
 * <p>is valid if "sales" is a registered
 * schema and "emps" is a member with zero parameters and a result type
 * of <code>Collection(Record(int: "empno", String: "name"))</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>A schema may be nested within another schema; see
 * {@link Schema#getSubSchema(String)}.</p>
