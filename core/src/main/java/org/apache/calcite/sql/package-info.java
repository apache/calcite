/**
 * Provides a SQL parser and object model.
 *
 * <p>This package, and the dependent <code>org.apache.calcite.sql.parser</code>
 * package, are independent of the other Calcite packages, so may be used
 * standalone.
 *
 * <h2>Parser</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link org.apache.calcite.sql.parser.SqlParser} parses a SQL string to a
 *     parse tree. It only performs the most basic syntactic validation.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Object model</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every node in the parse tree is a {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlNode}.
 *     Sub-types are:</p>
 * <ul>
 *
 *     <li>{@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlLiteral} represents a boolean,
 *         numeric, string, or date constant, or the value <code>NULL</code>.
 *         </li>
 *
 *     <li>{@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlIdentifier} represents an
 *         identifier, such as <code> EMPNO</code> or <code>emp.deptno</code>.
 *         </li>
 *
 *     <li>{@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlCall} is a call to an operator or
 *         function.  By means of special operators, we can use this construct
 *         to represent virtually every non-leaf node in the tree. For example,
 *         a <code>select</code> statement is a call to the 'select'
 *         operator.</li>
 *
 *     <li>{@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlNodeList} is a list of nodes.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlOperator} describes the behavior of a
 *     node in the tree, such as how to un-parse a
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlCall} into a SQL string.  It is
 *     important to note that operators are metadata, not data: there is only
 *     one <code>SqlOperator</code> instance representing the '=' operator, even
 *     though there may be many calls to it.</p>
 *
 * <p><code>SqlOperator</code> has several derived classes which make it easy to
 *     define new operators: {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlFunction},
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlBinaryOperator},
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlPrefixOperator},
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlPostfixOperator}.
 *
 *     And there are singleton classes for special syntactic constructs
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlSelectOperator}
 *     and {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlJoin.SqlJoinOperator}. (These
 *     special operators even have their own sub-types of
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlCall}:
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlSelect} and
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlJoin}.)</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlOperatorTable} is a collection of
 *     operators. By supplying your own operator table, you can customize the
 *     dialect of SQL without modifying the parser.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Validation</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link org.apache.calcite.sql.validate.SqlValidator} checks that
 *     a tree of {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlNode}s is
 *     semantically valid. You supply a
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlOperatorTable} to describe the available
 *     functions and operators, and a
 *     {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.validate.SqlValidatorCatalogReader} for
 *     access to the database's catalog.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Generating SQL</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlWriter} converts a tree of
 * {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlNode}s into a SQL string. A
 * {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlDialect} defines how this happens.</p>
