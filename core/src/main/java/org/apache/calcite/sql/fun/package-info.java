/**
 * Defines the set of standard SQL row-level functions and
 * operators.
 *
 * <p>The standard set of row-level functions and operators are declared in
 * class {@link org.apache.calcite.sql.fun.SqlStdOperatorTable}. Anonymous inner
 * classes within that table are allowed only for specifying an operator's test
 * function; if other custom code is needed for an operator, it should be
 * implemented in a top-level class within this package instead.  Operators
 * which are not row-level (e.g. select and join) should be defined in package
 * {@link org.apache.calcite.sql} instead.</p>
