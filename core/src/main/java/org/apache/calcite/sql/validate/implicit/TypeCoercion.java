/**
 * Default Strategies to coerce differing types that participate in
 * operations into compatible ones.
 *
 * <p>Notes about type widening / tightest common types: Broadly, there are two cases that need
 * to widen data types (i.e. set operations, binary comparison):
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Case1: Look for a common data type for two or more data types,
 * and no loss of precision is allowed. Including type inference for returned/operands
 * type (i.e. what's the column's common data type if one row is an integer while the
 * other row is a long?).</li>
 * <li>Case2: Look for a widen data type with some acceptable loss of precision
 * (i.e. there is no common type for double and decimal because double's range is larger than
 * decimal(with default max precision), and yet decimal is more precise than double,
 * but in union we would cast the decimal to double).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>REFERENCE: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-type-conversion-database-engine?">SQL-SERVER</a>
