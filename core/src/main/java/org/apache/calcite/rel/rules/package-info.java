/**
 * Provides a core set of planner rules.
 *
 * <p>Consider this package to be the "standard library" of planner rules.
 * Most of the common rewrites that you would want to perform on logical
 * relational expressions, or generically on any data source, are present,
 * and have been well tested.
 *
 * <p>Of course, the library is never complete, and contributions are welcome.
 *
 * <p>Not present are rules specific to a particular data source: look in that
 * data source's adapter.

 * <p>Also out of the scope of this package are rules that support a particular
 * operation, such as decorrelation or recognizing materialized views. Those are
 * defined along with the algorithm.
