/**
 * Planner rule that removes a {@code SemiJoin}s from a join tree.

 * indexed scan on a join factor have failed. Namely, if the join factor does
 * not reduce to a single table that can be scanned using an index.
 *
 * <p>It should only be enabled if all SemiJoins in the plan are advisory; that
 * is, they can be safely dropped without affecting the semantics of the query.
