/**
 * A function to customize whether a relational expression should match a hint.
 *
 * <p>Usually you may not need to implement this function,
 * {@link NodeTypeHintStrategy} is enough for most of the {@link RelHint}s.
 *
 * <p>Some of the hints can only be matched to the relational
 * expression with special match conditions(not only the relational expression type).
 * i.e. "hash_join(r, st)", this hint can only be applied to JOIN expression that
 * has "r" and "st" as the input table names. To implement this, you may need to customize an
 * {@link ExplicitHintStrategy} with the {@link ExplicitHintMatcher}.
 *
 * @param <R> Relational expression to test if the hint matches
