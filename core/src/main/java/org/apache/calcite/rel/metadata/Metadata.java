/**
 * Metadata about a relational expression.
 *
 * <p>For particular types of metadata, a sub-class defines one of more methods
 * to query that metadata. Then a {@link RelMetadataProvider} can offer those
 * kinds of metadata for particular sub-classes of {@link RelNode}.
 *
 * <p>User code (typically in a planner rule or an implementation of
 * {@link RelNode#computeSelfCost(org.apache.calcite.plan.RelOptPlanner)})
 * acquires a {@code Metadata} instance by calling {@link RelNode#metadata}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code Metadata} instance already knows which particular {@code RelNode}
 * it is describing, so the methods do not pass in the {@code RelNode}. In fact,
 * quite a few metadata methods have no extra parameters. For instance, you can
 * get the row-count as follows:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote><pre><code>
 * RelNode rel;
 * double rowCount = rel.metadata(RowCount.class).rowCount();
 * </code></pre></blockquote>
