/**
 * Base class for any join whose condition is based on column equality.
 *
 * <p>For most of the cases, {@link JoinInfo#isEqui()} can already decide
 * if the join condition is based on column equality.
 *
 * <p>{@code EquiJoin} is an abstract class for inheritance of Calcite enumerable
 * joins and join implementation of other system. You should inherit the {@code EquiJoin}
 * if your join implementation does not support non-equi join conditions. Calcite would
 * eliminate some optimize logic for {@code EquiJoin} in some planning rules.
 * e.g. {@link org.apache.calcite.rel.rules.FilterJoinRule} would not push non-equi
 * join conditions of the above filter into the join underneath if it is an {@code EquiJoin}.
 *
 * @deprecated This class is no longer needed; if you are writing a sub-class of
 * Join that only accepts equi conditions, it is sufficient that it extends
 * {@link Join}. It will be evident that it is an equi-join when its
 * {@link JoinInfo#nonEquiConditions} is an empty list.
