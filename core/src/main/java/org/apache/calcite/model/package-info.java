/**
 * Provides model files, in JSON format, defining schemas and other metadata.
 *
 * <p>Models are specified using a <code>model=&lt;uri&gt;</code> parameter on
 * the JDBC connect string. Calcite loads the model while initializing the
 * connection. It first parses the JSON, then uses a
 * {@link org.apache.calcite.model.ModelHandler} as visitor over the parse
 * tree.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are standard implementations of schema and table, but the user can
 * provide their own by implementing the
 * {@link org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaFactory}
 * or {@link org.apache.calcite.schema.TableFactory}
 * interfaces and including a custom schema in the model.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are several examples of schemas in the
 * <a href="https://calcite.apache.org/docs/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
