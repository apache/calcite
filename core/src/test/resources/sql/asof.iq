# These results have been validated against DuckDB
# Note that DuckDB has a slightly different syntax for ASOF joins,
# so the queries have to be rewritten.
# Also, DuckDB compares nulls in keys as larger than any value,
# so the results differ for tuples with null keys.  We believe that
# the behavior of DuckDB is wrong, since logically the result of an
# ASOF JOIN should always be a subset of the result produced by
# the corresponding normal JOIN.

# Test case for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6641
# Compiling programs with ASOF joins can report obscure errors
