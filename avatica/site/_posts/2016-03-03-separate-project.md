This marks the separation of Avatica from it's previous location as a sub-module
of Apache Calcite's Maven build. This separation is not to remove Avatica from
the governance of the Apache Calcite project, but to allow for even more rapid
releases from both the Avatica and Calcite projects. We can confidently make new
releases of each without having to worry about the current state of development
features in the other.
