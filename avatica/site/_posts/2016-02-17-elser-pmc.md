The Apache Calcite project management committee (PMC) today announced the
appointment of [Josh Elser](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/calcite-dev/201602.mbox/%3C12AA8D09-BBF8-470B-8933-5B672162546C%40apache.org%3E)
to the committee.

Josh has only been a committer for a few months, but has become a prominent
member of the Calcite project, and has taken leadership in several areas,
not least in discussing [the future of Avatica](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/calcite-dev/201601.mbox/%3C56ABCCFF.3010205%40gmail.com%3E).
