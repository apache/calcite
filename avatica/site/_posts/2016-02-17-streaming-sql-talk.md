Julian Hyde gave a talk at the [Apache Samza](http://samza.apache.org/)
meetup in Mountain View, CA.

His talk asked the questions:

* What is [SamzaSQL](https://github.com/milinda/samza-sql),
  and what might I use it for?
* Does this mean that Samza is turning into a database?
* What is a query optimizer, and what can it do for my streaming queries?

The talk is available in
[[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/julianhyde/streaming-sql)]
and
[[video](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/83322450#to00:55:48)].
