The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }})
is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.10.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-10-0).

This release comes shortly after 1.9.0. It includes mainly bug fixes for the core and
Druid adapter. For the latest, we fixed an
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1403">important issue</a> that
prevented us from handling consistently time dimensions in different time zones.
