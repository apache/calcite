A new Apache Calcite adapter allows you to access
[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) via industry-standard SQL.

You can map a Cassandra keyspace into Calcite as a schema, Cassandra
CQL tables as tables, and execute SQL queries on them, which Calcite
converts into [CQL](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql/CQL.html).
Cassandra can define and maintain materialized views but the adapter
goes further: it can transparently rewrite a query to use a
materialized view even if the view is not mentioned in the query.

Read more about the adapter [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/cassandra.html).

The Cassandra adapter is available as part of
[Apache Calcite version 1.7.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-7-0),
which has just been released. Calcite also has
[adapters]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/adapter.html)
for CSV and JSON files, and JDBC data source, MongoDB, Spark and Splunk.
