The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }}) is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.41.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-41-0).

This release comes 5 months after [1.40.0](#v1-40-0),
contains contributions from 41 contributors, and resolves 155 issues.

Highlights include support for several `UNSIGNED` types in the type system,
get functional dependency metadata in `RelMetadataQuery`,
supporting various join types on DPhyp join reorder algorithm,
a new API for finding common relational sub-expressions,
and new bitwise operators. Regarding this last feature, it can be possible for a certain bitwise operator and its
corresponding already existing SQL function to have discrepancies on operand type checker and return type inference when
unsigned parameters are involved; this shall be aligned in future versions.
