The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }}) is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.34.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-34-0).

This release comes 1 month after [1.33.0](#v1-33-0),
contains contributions from 18 contributors, and resolves 34 issues.

It's worth highlighting the introduction of QUALIFY clause ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-5268">CALCITE-5268</a>]),
which facilitates filtering the results of window functions. Among other improvements and fixes, it
adds roughly 15 new functions in BigQuery library for handling dates, times, and timestamps, and
provides a fix ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-5522">CALCITE-5522</a>])
for a small breaking change in `DATE_TRUNC` function ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-5447">CALCITE-5447</a>]), which was
introduced accidentally in [1.33.0](#v1-33-0).
