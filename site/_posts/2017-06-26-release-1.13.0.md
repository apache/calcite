The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }})
is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.13.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-13-0).

This release comes three months after 1.12.0. It includes more than 75 resolved issues, comprising
a large number of new features as well as general improvements and bug-fixes.

First, Calcite has been upgraded to use
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1807">Avatica 1.10.0</a>,
which was recently released.

Moreover, Calcite core includes improvements which aim at making it more powerful, stable and robust.
In addition to numerous bux-fixes, we have implemented a
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1731">new materialized view rewriting algorithm</a>
and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1682">new metadata providers</a> which
should prove useful for data processing systems relying on Calcite.

In this release, we have also completed the work to
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1570">support the `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` clause</a>
used in complex-event processing (CEP).

In addition, more progress has been made for the different adapters.
For instance, the Druid adapter now relies on
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1771">Druid 0.10.0</a> and
it can generate more efficient plans where most of the computation can be pushed to Druid,
e.g., <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1707">using extraction functions</a>.
