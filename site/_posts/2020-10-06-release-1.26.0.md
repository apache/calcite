The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }})
is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.26.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-26-0).

**Warning:** Calcite 1.26.0 has **severe** issues with `RexNode` simplification caused by `SEARCH operator` (
wrong data from query optimization, `NullPointerException`), so use 1.26.0 for development only,
and beware that Calcite 1.26.0 would corrupt your data.

This release comes about two months after 1.25.0 and includes more than 70 resolved
issues, comprising a lot of new features and bug-fixes. Among others, it is worth highlighting the following.

* [SEARCH operator and Sarg literal](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4173)
* [PIVOT operator in SQL](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3752)
* [Spatial index based on Hilbert space-filling curve](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1861)
* [Provide utility to visualize RelNode](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4197)
* [Support JDK 15 and Guava version 29.0-jre](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4259)
