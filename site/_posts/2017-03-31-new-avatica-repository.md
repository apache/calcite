The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }})
is pleased to announce further growth of its sub-project, Avatica.

Avatica has been slowly growing inside of Calcite for many years (dating back
to Optiq-0.4.x!). The team has taken the next step to hoist the Avatica code
out of the Calcite repository into its own. The team felt like this was the
next logical step given the maturity of the project.

The previous "/avatica" directory in the Calcite repository has been removed, so
further contributions should be submitted agains the new repository. The de-facto
repository can be found at the ASF's [Git hosting](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/calcite-avatica.git),
with a mirrored-copy also available on Github at [apache/calcite-avatica](https://github.com/apache/calcite-avatica).
