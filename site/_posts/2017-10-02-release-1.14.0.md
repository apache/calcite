The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }})
is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.14.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-14-0).

This release comes three months after 1.13.0. It includes 68 resolved issues with many improvements and bug fixes.
This release brings some big new features.
The `GEOMETRY` data type was added along with 35 associated functions as the start of support for Simple Feature Access.
There are also two new adapters.

Firstly, the Elasticsearch 5 adapter which now exists in parallel with the previous Elasticsearch 2 adapter.
Additionally there is now an [OS adapter]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/os_adapter.html) which exposes operating system metrics as relational tables.
`ThetaSketch` and `HyperUnique` support has also been added to the Druid adapter.
Several minor improvements are added as well including improved `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` support, quantified comparison predicates, and `ARRAY` and `MULTISET` support for UDFs.
