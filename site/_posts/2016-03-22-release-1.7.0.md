Apache Calcite 1.7.0 is the first release since
[Avatica became an independent project]({{ site.avaticaBaseurl }}/news/2016/03/03/separate-project/).
Calcite now depends on [Avatica]({{ site.avaticaBaseurl }}/) in the
same way as it does other libraries, via a Maven dependency. To see
Avatica-related changes, see the
[release notes for Avatica 1.7.1]({{ site.avaticaBaseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-7-1).

We have [added](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1080)
an [adapter]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/cassandra.html) for
[Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).
You can map a Cassandra keyspace into Calcite as a schema, Cassandra
CQL tables as tables, and execute SQL queries on them, which Calcite
converts into [CQL](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql/CQL.html).
Cassandra can define and maintain materialized views but the adapter
goes further: it can transparently rewrite a query to use a
materialized view even if the view is not mentioned in the query.

This release adds an
[Oracle-compatibility mode](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1066).
If you add `fun=oracle` to your JDBC connect string, you get all of
the standard operators and functions plus Oracle-specific functions
`DECODE`, `NVL`, `LTRIM`, `RTRIM`, `GREATEST` and `LEAST`. We look
forward to adding more functions, and compatibility modes for other
databases, in future releases.

We've replaced our use of JUL (`java.util.logging`)
with [SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/). SLF4J provides an API which Calcite can use
independent of the logging implementation. This ultimately provides additional
flexibility to users, allowing them to configure Calcite's logging within their
own chosen logging framework. This work was done in
[[CALCITE-669](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-669)].

For users experienced with configuring JUL in Calcite previously, there are some
differences as some the JUL logging levels do not exist in SLF4J: `FINE`,
`FINER`, and `FINEST`, specifically. To deal with this, `FINE` was mapped
to SLF4J's `DEBUG` level, while `FINER` and `FINEST` were mapped to SLF4J's `TRACE`.
