The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }}) is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.37.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-37-0).

This release comes 5 months after [1.36.0](#v1-36-0),
contains contributions from 46 contributors, and resolves 138 issues. It's worth highlighting the
introduction of adapter for Apache Arrow ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2040">CALCITE-2040</a>]),
StarRocks dialect ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6257">CALCITE-6257</a>]).
The release also added support for lambda expressions in SQL ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3679">CALCITE-3679</a>]),
'Must-filter' columns ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6219">CALCITE-6219</a>]).
For table function calls it is now possible to use them without `TABLE()` wrapper in `FROM` ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6254">CALCITE-6254</a>]).
Furthermore, there is support for optional `FORMAT` of `CAST` operator from SQL:2016 ([<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6254">CALCITE-6254</a>])
and more than 15 new SQL functions in various libraries such as BigQuery, PostgreSQL and Spark.
