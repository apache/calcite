On January 20, we are organising an online [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Apache-Calcite/events/275461117/) for Apache
Calcite.

The main purpose is to bring the community together allowing newcomers and senior members to interact and exchange ideas
on various topics.

During the occasion we will have a few presentations covering introductory Calcite concepts, recent & ongoing work on
streams, spatial query implementation, and integration of Calcite in Hazelcast, followed by open discussion and
virtual key signing party.

For more details check the agenda on [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Apache-Calcite/events/275461117/).
