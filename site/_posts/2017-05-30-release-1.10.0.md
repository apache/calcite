Apache Calcite Avatica 1.10.0 adds support for JDBC Array data,
Docker, and JDK 9.

From this release onwards, Docker images for Avatica Server are
published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/calcite-avatica).  These
make Avatica [easier than ever to run]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/docker).

As the Calcite and Avatica projects become
[more separate]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/2016/03/03/separate-project),
it is the first release since Avatica's git repository
[separated from Calcite's repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/2017/03/31/new-avatica-repository).

Avatica now runs on JDK 9 (and continues to run on JDK 7 and 8).

Clients may now send and receive Array data via the JDBC API.
There are improvements to date/time support in
[DateTimeUtils]({{ site.apiRoot }}/org/apache/calcite/avatica/util/DateTimeUtils.html),
and over 20 [other new features and bug fixes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-10-0).
