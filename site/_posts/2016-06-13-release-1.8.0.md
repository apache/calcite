The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }})
is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.8.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-8-0).

This release adds adapters for
[Elasticsearch](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1253) and
[Druid](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1121).
It is also now easier to
[make a JDBC connection based upon a single adapter](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1259).

There are several new SQL features: `UNNEST` with
[multiple arguments](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-855),
[MAP arguments](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1250)
and [with a JOIN](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1225);
a [DESCRIBE](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1168) statement;
and a [TRANSLATE](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1115)
function like the one in Oracle and PostgreSQL.

We also added support for
[SELECT without FROM](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1120)
(equivalent to the `VALUES` clause, and widely used in MySQL and PostgreSQL),
and added a
[conformance]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/adapter.html#jdbc-connect-string-parameters)
parameter to allow you to selectively enable this and other SQL features.

And, as usual, there are a couple of dozen bug-fixes and enhancements to
planner rules and APIs.
