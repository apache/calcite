The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }})
is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.16.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-16-0).

This release comes three months after 1.15.0. It includes more than 80 resolved
issues, comprising a large number of new features as well as general improvements
and bug-fixes to Calcite core. Among others:

* Calcite has been upgraded to use
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2182">Avatica 1.11.0</a>,
which was recently released.
* Moreover, a new adapter to
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2059">read data from Apache Geode</a>
was added in this release. In addition, more progress has been made for the existing adapters,
e.g., the Druid adapter can generate
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2077">`SCAN` queries rather than `SELECT` queries</a>
for more efficient execution and it can push
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2170">more work to Druid using its new expressions capabilities</a>,
and the JDBC adapter now <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2128">supports the SQL dialect used by Jethro Data</a>.
* Finally, this release
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2027">drops support for JDK 1.7</a> and
support for <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2191">Guava versions earlier than 19</a>.
