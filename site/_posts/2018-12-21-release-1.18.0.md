The [Apache Calcite PMC]({{ site.baseurl }})
is pleased to announce
[Apache Calcite release 1.18.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-18-0).

With over 200 commits from 36 contributors, this is the largest
Calcite release ever. To the SQL dialect, we added
[JSON functions](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2266),
[linear regression functions](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2402),
and the
[WITHIN GROUP](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2224)
clause for aggregate functions; there is a new
[utility to recommend lattices based on past queries](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1870),
and improvements to expression simplification, the SQL advisor,
and the Elasticsearch and Apache Geode adapters.
