        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>Apache Calcite is an effort undergoing incubation at
          <a href="http://www.apache.org">The Apache Software Foundation</a>,
          sponsored by the
          <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a>.
          Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
          until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
          communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a
          manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
          incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
          completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
          project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
