      <p>Avatica is defined by a wire API between a client and a server. The Avatica server is
      an HTTP server, the Avatica client is a JDBC driver, and the wire API is defined by
      JSON or Protobuf Buffers. The flexibility of the wire API and HTTP transport allows
      other Avatica clients to be built in any language, implementing any client specification.</p>
      <p>Avatica is a sub-project of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/..">Apache Calcite project</a>.
      Please refer to Calcite for information about the project as a whole.</p>
