**Note**: Arrow Adapter is an experimental feature;
changes in public API and usage are expected.

## Overview

Calcite's adapter for Apache Arrow is able to read and process data in Arrow
format.

It can read files in Arrow's
[Feather format](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/feather-and-apache-arrow/)
(which generally have a `.arrow` suffix) in the same way that the
[File Adapter](file_adapter.html) can read `.csv` files.

The File Adapter immediately translates data to
[Enumerable format]({{ site.apiRoot }}/org/apache/calcite/adapter/enumerable/EnumerableConvention.html)
for further processing, but Arrow is an extremely efficient format for
processing in-memory data, so the Arrow Adapter has implementations of other
relational operators for further processing.

## A simple example

Let's start with a simple example. First, we need a
[model definition]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/model.html),
as follows.

{% highlight json %}
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultSchema": "ARROW",
  "schemas": [
    {
      "name": "ARROW",
      "type": "custom",
      "factory": "org.apache.calcite.adapter.arrow.ArrowSchemaFactory",
      "operand": {
        "directory": "arrow"
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The model file is stored as `arrow/src/test/resources/arrow-model.json`,
so you can connect via [`sqlline`](https://github.com/julianhyde/sqlline)
as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./sqlline
sqlline> !connect jdbc:calcite:model=arrow/src/test/resources/arrow-model.json admin admin
sqlline> select * from arrow.test;
+----------+----------+------------+
| fieldOne | fieldTwo | fieldThree |
+----------+----------+------------+
|        1 | abc      |        1.2 |
|        2 | def      |        3.4 |
|        3 | xyz      |        5.6 |
|        4 | abcd     |       1.22 |
|        5 | defg     |       3.45 |
|        6 | xyza     |       5.67 |
+----------+----------+------------+
6 rows selected
{% endhighlight %}

The `arrow` directory contains a file called `test.arrow`, and so it shows up as
a table called `test`.
