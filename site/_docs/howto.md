Here's some miscellaneous documentation about using Calcite and its various
adapters.

* TOC
{:toc}

## Building from a source distribution

Prerequisites are maven (3.2.1 or later)
and Java (JDK 7, 8 or 9) on your path.

Unpack the source distribution `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file,
`cd` to the root directory of the unpacked source,
then build using maven:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tar xvfz calcite-1.12.0-source.tar.gz
$ cd calcite-1.12.0
$ mvn install
{% endhighlight %}

[Running tests](#running-tests) describes how to run more or fewer
tests.

## Building from git

Prerequisites are git, maven (3.2.1 or later)
and Java (JDK 7 or later, 8 preferred) on your path.

Create a local copy of the github repository,
`cd` to its root directory,
then build using maven:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/apache/calcite.git
$ cd calcite
$ mvn install
{% endhighlight %}

Calcite includes a number of machine-generated codes. By default, these are
regenerated on every build, but this has the negative side-effect of causing
a re-compilation of the entire project when the non-machine-generated code
has not changed. To make sure incremental compilation still works as intended,
provide the `skipGenerate` command line option with your maven command.
If you invoke the `clean` lifecycle phase, you must not specify the
`skipGenerate` option as it will not recompile the necessary code for the build
to succeed.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mvn clean
$ mvn package
... hacks ...
$ mvn package -DskipGenerate
{% endhighlight %}

[Running tests](#running-tests) describes how to run more or fewer
tests.

## Running tests

The test suite will run by default when you build, unless you specify
`-DskipTests`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mvn -DskipTests clean install
$ mvn test
{% endhighlight %}

There are other options that control which tests are run, and in what
environment, as follows.

* `-Dcalcite.test.db=DB` (where db is `h2`, `hsqldb`, `mysql`, or `postgresql`) allows you
  to change the JDBC data source for the test suite. Calcite's test
  suite requires a JDBC data source populated with the foodmart data
  set.
   * `hsqldb`, the default, uses an in-memory hsqldb database.
   * All others access a test virtual machine
     (see [integration tests](#running-integration-tests) below).
     `mysql` and `postgresql` might be somewhat faster than hsqldb, but you need
     to populate it (i.e. provision a VM).
* `-Dcalcite.debug` prints extra debugging information to stdout.
* `-Dcalcite.test.slow` enables tests that take longer to execute. For
  example, there are tests that create virtual TPC-H and TPC-DS schemas
  in-memory and run tests from those benchmarks.
* `-Dcalcite.test.splunk` enables tests that run against Splunk.
  Splunk must be installed and running.

## Running integration tests

For testing Calcite's external adapters, a test virtual machine should be used.
The VM includes Cassandra, Druid, H2, HSQLDB, MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

Test VM requires 5GiB of disk space and it takes 30 minutes to build.

Note: you can use [calcite-test-dataset](https://github.com/vlsi/calcite-test-dataset)
 to populate your own database, however it is recommended to use test VM so the test environment can be reproduced.

### VM preparation

0) Install dependencies: [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

1) Clone https://github.com/vlsi/calcite-test-dataset.git at the same level as calcite repository.
For instance:

{% highlight bash %}
code
  +-- calcite
  +-- calcite-test-dataset
{% endhighlight %}

Note: integration tests search for ../calcite-test-dataset or ../../calcite-test-dataset.
 You can specify full path via calcite.test.dataset system property.

2) Build and start the VM:

{% highlight bash %}
cd calcite-test-dataset && mvn install
{% endhighlight %}

### VM management

Test VM is provisioned by Vagrant, so regular Vagrant `vagrant up` and `vagrant halt` should be used to start and stop the VM.
The connection strings for different databases are listed in [calcite-test-dataset](https://github.com/vlsi/calcite-test-dataset) readme.

### Suggested test flow

Note: test VM should be started before you launch integration tests. Calcite itself does not start/stop the VM.

Command line:

* Executing regular unit tests (does not require external data): no change. `mvn test` or `mvn install`.
* Executing all tests, for all the DBs: `mvn verify -Pit`. `it` stands for "integration-test". `mvn install -Pit` works as well.
* Executing just tests for external DBs, excluding unit tests: `mvn -Dtest=foo -DfailIfNoTests=false -Pit verify`
* Executing just MongoDB tests: `cd mongo; mvn verify -Pit`

From within IDE:

* Executing regular unit tests: no change.
* Executing MongoDB tests: run `MongoAdapterIT.java` as usual (no additional properties are required)
* Executing MySQL tests: run `JdbcTest` and `JdbcAdapterTest` with setting `-Dcalcite.test.db=mysql`
* Executing PostgreSQL tests: run `JdbcTest` and `JdbcAdapterTest` with setting `-Dcalcite.test.db=postgresql`

### Integration tests technical details

Tests with external data are executed at maven's integration-test phase.
We do not currently use pre-integration-test/post-integration-test, however we could use that in future.
The verification of build pass/failure is performed at verify phase.
Integration tests should be named `...IT.java`, so they are not picked up on unit test execution.

## Contributing

## Getting started

See the [developers guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/develop/#getting-started).

## Tracing

To enable tracing, add the following flags to the java command line:

`-Dcalcite.debug=true`

The first flag causes Calcite to print the Java code it generates
(to execute queries) to stdout. It is especially useful if you are debugging
mysterious problems like this:

`Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: Integer cannot be cast to Long
  at Baz$1$1.current(Unknown Source)`

By default, Calcite uses the Log4j bindings for SLF4J. There is a provided configuration
file which outputs logging at the INFO level to the console in `core/src/test/resources/log4j.properties`.
You can modify the level for the rootLogger to increase verbosity or change the level
for a specific class if you so choose.

{% highlight properties %}
# Change rootLogger level to WARN
log4j.rootLogger=WARN, A1
# Increase level to DEBUG for RelOptPlanner
log4j.logger.org.apache.calcite.plan.RelOptPlanner=DEBUG
# Increase level to TRACE for HepPlanner
log4j.logger.org.apache.calcite.plan.hep.HepPlanner=TRACE
{% endhighlight %}

## CSV adapter

See the [tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorial.html).

## MongoDB adapter

First, download and install Calcite,
and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">install MongoDB</a>.

Note: you can use MongoDB from integration test virtual machine above.

Import MongoDB's zipcode data set into MongoDB:

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl -o /tmp/zips.json http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json
$ mongoimport --db test --collection zips --file /tmp/zips.json
Tue Jun  4 16:24:14.190 check 9 29470
Tue Jun  4 16:24:14.469 imported 29470 objects
{% endhighlight %}

Log into MongoDB to check it's there:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mongo
MongoDB shell version: 2.4.3
connecting to: test
> db.zips.find().limit(3)
{ "city" : "ACMAR", "loc" : [ -86.51557, 33.584132 ], "pop" : 6055, "state" : "AL", "_id" : "35004" }
{ "city" : "ADAMSVILLE", "loc" : [ -86.959727, 33.588437 ], "pop" : 10616, "state" : "AL", "_id" : "35005" }
{ "city" : "ADGER", "loc" : [ -87.167455, 33.434277 ], "pop" : 3205, "state" : "AL", "_id" : "35006" }
> exit
bye
{% endhighlight %}

Connect using the
[mongo-zips-model.json]({{ site.sourceRoot }}/mongodb/src/test/resources/mongo-zips-model.json)
Calcite model:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./sqlline
sqlline> !connect jdbc:calcite:model=mongodb/target/test-classes/mongo-zips-model.json admin admin

{% endhighlight %}

## Splunk adapter

To run the test suite and sample queries against Splunk,
load Splunk's `tutorialdata.zip` data set as described in
<a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.0.2/PivotTutorial/GetthetutorialdataintoSplunk">the Splunk tutorial</a>.

(This step is optional, but it provides some interesting data for the sample
queries. It is also necessary if you intend to run the test suite, using
`-Dcalcite.test.splunk=true`.)

## Implementing an adapter

New adapters can be created by implementing `CalcitePrepare.Context`:

{% highlight java %}
import org.apache.calcite.adapter.java.JavaTypeFactory;
import org.apache.calcite.jdbc.CalcitePrepare;
import org.apache.calcite.jdbc.CalciteSchema;

public class AdapterContext implements CalcitePrepare.Context {
  @Override
  public JavaTypeFactory getTypeFactory() {
    // adapter implementation
    return typeFactory;
  }

  @Override
  public CalciteSchema getRootSchema() {
    // adapter implementation
    return rootSchema;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Testing adapter in Java

The example below shows how SQL query can be submitted to
`CalcitePrepare` with a custom context (`AdapterContext` in this
case). Calcite prepares and implements the query execution, using the
resources provided by the `Context`. `CalcitePrepare.PrepareResult`
provides access to the underlying enumerable and methods for
enumeration. The enumerable itself can naturally be some adapter
specific implementation.

{% highlight java %}
import org.apache.calcite.jdbc.CalcitePrepare;
import org.apache.calcite.prepare.CalcitePrepareImpl;
import org.junit.Test;

public class AdapterContextTest {
  @Test
  public void testSelectAllFromTable() {
    AdapterContext ctx = new AdapterContext();
    String sql = "SELECT * FROM TABLENAME";
    Class elementType = Object[].class;
    CalcitePrepare.PrepareResult<Object> prepared =
        new CalcitePrepareImpl().prepareSql(ctx, sql, null, elementType, -1);
    Object enumerable = prepared.getExecutable();
    // etc.
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Advanced topics for developers

The following sections might be of interest if you are adding features
to particular parts of the code base. You don't need to understand
these topics if you are just building from source and running tests.

## JavaTypeFactory

When Calcite compares types (instances of `RelDataType`), it requires them to be the same
object. If there are two distinct type instances that refer to the
same Java type, Calcite may fail to recognize that they match.  It is
recommended to:

* Use a single instance of `JavaTypeFactory` within the calcite context;
* Store the types so that the same object is always returned for the same type.

## Rebuilding generated Protocol Buffer code

Calcite's Avatica Server component supports RPC serialization
using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
In the context of Avatica, Protocol Buffers can
generate a collection of messages defined by a schema. The library
itself can parse old serialized messages using a
new schema. This is highly desirable in an environment where the
client and server are not guaranteed to have the same version of
objects.

Typically, the code generated by the Protocol Buffers library doesn't
need to be re-generated only every build, only when the schema changes.

First, install Protobuf 3.0:

{% highlight bash %}
$ wget https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.0.0-beta-1/protobuf-java-3.0.0-beta-1.tar.gz
$ tar xf protobuf-java-3.0.0-beta-1.tar.gz && cd protobuf-3.0.0-beta-1
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

Then, re-generate the compiled code:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd avatica/core
$ ./src/main/scripts/generate-protobuf.sh
{% endhighlight %}

# Advanced topics for committers

The following sections are of interest to Calcite committers and in
particular release managers.

## Set up PGP signing keys (for Calcite committers)

Follow instructions [here](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing) to
create a key pair. (On Mac OS X, I did `brew install gpg` and
`gpg --gen-key`.)

Add your public key to the
[`KEYS`](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/calcite/KEYS)
file by following instructions in the `KEYS` file.
(The `KEYS` file is not present in the git repo or in a release tar
ball because that would be
[redundant](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1746).)

## Making a snapshot (for Calcite committers)

Before you start:

* Set up signing keys as described above.
* Make sure you are using JDK 8 (not 7 or 9).
* Make sure build and tests succeed with `-Dcalcite.test.db=hsqldb` (the default)

{% highlight bash %}
# Set passphrase variable without putting it into shell history
read -s GPG_PASSPHRASE

# Make sure that there are no junk files in the sandbox
git clean -xn
mvn clean

mvn -Papache-release -Dgpg.passphrase=${GPG_PASSPHRASE} install
{% endhighlight %}

When the dry-run has succeeded, change `install` to `deploy`.

## Making a release (for Calcite committers)

Before you start:

* Set up signing keys as described above.
* Make sure you are using JDK 8 (not 7 or 9).
* Check that `README` and `site/_docs/howto.md` have the correct version number.
* Check that `NOTICE` has the current copyright year.
* Set `version.major` and `version.minor` in `pom.xml`.
* Make sure build and tests succeed, including with `-P it,it-oracle`.
* Make sure that `mvn javadoc:javadoc javadoc:test-javadoc` succeeds
  (i.e. gives no errors; warnings are OK)
* Make sure that `mvn apache-rat:check` succeeds. (It will be run as part of
  the release, but it's better to trouble-shoot early.)
* Decide the supported configurations of JDK, operating system and
  Guava.  These will probably be the same as those described in the
  release notes of the previous release.  Document them in the release
  notes.  To test Guava version x.y, specify `-Dguava.version=x.y`
* Optional extra tests:
  * `-Dcalcite.test.db=mysql`
  * `-Dcalcite.test.db=hsqldb`
  * `-Dcalcite.test.slow`
  * `-Dcalcite.test.mongodb`
  * `-Dcalcite.test.splunk`
* Trigger a
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/2966">Coverity scan</a>
  by merging the latest code into the `julianhyde/coverity_scan` branch,
  and when it completes, make sure that there are no important issues.
* Add release notes to `site/_docs/history.md`. Include the commit history,
  and say which versions of Java, Guava and operating systems the release is
  tested against.
* Make sure that
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CALCITE%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved%20and%20fixVersion%20is%20null">
  every "resolved" JIRA case</a> (including duplicates) has
  a fix version assigned (most likely the version we are
  just about to release)

Create a release branch named after the release, e.g. `branch-1.1`, and push it to Apache.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git checkout -b branch-X.Y
$ git push -u origin branch-X.Y
{% endhighlight %}

We will use the branch for the entire the release process. Meanwhile,
we do not allow commits to the master branch. After the release is
final, we can use `git merge --ff-only` to append the changes on the
release branch onto the master branch. (Apache does not allow reverts
to the master branch, which makes it difficult to clean up the kind of
messy commits that inevitably happen while you are trying to finalize
a release.)

Now, set up your environment and do a dry run. The dry run will not
commit any changes back to git and gives you the opportunity to verify
that the release process will complete as expected.

If any of the steps fail, clean up (see below), fix the problem, and
start again from the top.

{% highlight bash %}
# Set passphrase variable without putting it into shell history
read -s GPG_PASSPHRASE

# Make sure that there are no junk files in the sandbox
git clean -xn
mvn clean

# Do a dry run of the release:prepare step, which sets version numbers
mvn -DdryRun=true -DskipTests -DreleaseVersion=X.Y.Z -DdevelopmentVersion=X.Y+1.Z-SNAPSHOT -Papache-release -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=${GPG_PASSPHRASE}" release:prepare 2>&1 | tee /tmp/prepare-dry.log
{% endhighlight %}

Check the artifacts:

* In the `target` directory should be these 8 files, among others:
  * apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz
  * apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.asc
  * apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.md5
  * apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.sha1
  * apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src.zip
  * apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src.zip.asc
  * apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src.zip.md5
  * apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src.zip.sha1
* Note that the file names start `apache-calcite-`.
* In the two source distros `.tar.gz` and `.zip` (currently there is
  no binary distro), check that all files belong to a directory called
  `apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-src`.
* That directory must contain files `NOTICE`, `LICENSE`,
  `README`, `README.md`
  * Check that the version in `README` is correct
  * Check that the copyright year in `NOTICE` is correct
* Make sure that there is no `KEYS` file in the source distros
* In each .jar (for example
  `core/target/calcite-core-X.Y.Z.jar` and
  `mongodb/target/calcite-mongodb-X.Y.Z-sources.jar`), check
  that the `META-INF` directory contains `DEPENDENCIES`, `LICENSE`,
  `NOTICE` and `git.properties`
* In `core/target/calcite-core-X.Y.Z.jar`,
  check that `org-apache-calcite-jdbc.properties` is
  present and does not contain un-substituted `${...}` variables
* Check PGP, per [this](https://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html)

Now, remove the `-DdryRun` flag and run the release for real.

{% highlight bash %}
# Prepare sets the version numbers, creates a tag, and pushes it to git
mvn -DdryRun=false -DskipTests -DreleaseVersion=X.Y.Z -DdevelopmentVersion=X.Y+1.Z-SNAPSHOT -Papache-release -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=${GPG_PASSPHRASE}" release:prepare 2>&1 | tee /tmp/prepare.log

# Perform checks out the tagged version, builds, and deploys to the staging repository
mvn -DskipTests -Papache-release -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=${GPG_PASSPHRASE}" release:perform 2>&1 | tee /tmp/perform.log
{% endhighlight %}

Verify the staged artifacts in the Nexus repository:

* Go to [https://repository.apache.org/](https://repository.apache.org/) and login
* Under `Build Promotion`, click `Staging Repositories`
* In the `Staging Repositories` tab there should be a line with profile `org.apache.calcite`
* Navigate through the artifact tree and make sure the .jar, .pom, .asc files are present
* Check the box on in the first column of the row,
  and press the 'Close' button to publish the repository at
  https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachecalcite-1000
  (or a similar URL)

Upload the artifacts via subversion to a staging area,
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/calcite/apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-rcN:

{% highlight bash %}
# Create a subversion workspace, if you haven't already
mkdir -p ~/dist/dev
pushd ~/dist/dev
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/calcite
popd

# Replace digest files with a single digest
cd target
for f in *.tar.gz *.zip; do
  rm ${f}.md5 ${f}.sha1
  gpg --print-mds ${f} > ${f}.mds
done

# Move the files into a directory
mkdir ~/dist/dev/calcite/apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-rcN
mv apache-calcite-* ~/dist/dev/calcite/apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-rcN

# Check in
cd ~/dist/dev/calcite
svn add apache-calcite-X.Y.Z-rcN
svn ci
{% endhighlight %}

## Cleaning up after a failed release attempt (for Calcite committers)

{% highlight bash %}
# Make sure that the tag you are about to generate does not already
# exist (due to a failed release attempt)
git tag

# If the tag exists, delete it locally and remotely
git tag -d calcite-X.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/calcite-X.Y.Z

# Remove modified files
mvn release:clean

# Check whether there are modified files and if so, go back to the
# original git commit
git status
git reset --hard HEAD
{% endhighlight %}

## Validate a release

{% highlight bash %}
# Check that the signing key (e.g. DDB6E9812AD3FAE3) is pushed
gpg --recv-keys key

# Check keys
curl -O https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/calcite/KEYS

# Sign/check md5 and sha1 hashes
# (Assumes your O/S has 'md5' and 'sha1' commands.)
function checkHash() {

## Publishing a release (for Calcite committers)

After a successful release vote, we need to push the release
out to mirrors, and other tasks.

Choose a release date.
