Relational algebra is at the heart of Calcite. Every query is
represented as a tree of relational operators. You can translate from
SQL to relational algebra, or you can build the tree directly.

Planner rules transform expression trees using mathematical identities
that preserve semantics. For example, it is valid to push a filter
into an input of an inner join if the filter does not reference
columns from the other input.

Calcite optimizes queries by repeatedly applying planner rules to a
relational expression. A cost model guides the process, and the
planner engine generates an alternative expression that has the same
semantics as the original but a lower cost.

The planning process is extensible. You can add your own relational
operators, planner rules, cost model, and statistics.

## Algebra builder

The simplest way to build a relational expression is to use the algebra builder,
[RelBuilder]({{ site.apiRoot }}/org/apache/calcite/tools/RelBuilder.html).
Here is an example:

### TableScan

{% highlight java %}
final FrameworkConfig config;
final RelBuilder builder = RelBuilder.create(config);
final RelNode node = builder
  .scan("EMP")
  .build();
System.out.println(RelOptUtil.toString(node));
{% endhighlight %}

(You can find the full code for this and other examples in
[RelBuilderExample.java]({{ site.sourceRoot }}/core/src/test/java/org/apache/calcite/examples/RelBuilderExample.java).)

The code prints

{% highlight text %}
LogicalTableScan(table=[[scott, EMP]])
{% endhighlight %}

It has created a scan of the `EMP` table; equivalent to the SQL

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM scott.EMP;
{% endhighlight %}

### Adding a Project

Now, let's add a Project, the equivalent of

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT ename, deptno
FROM scott.EMP;
{% endhighlight %}

We just add a call to the `project` method before calling
`build`:

{% highlight java %}
final RelNode node = builder
  .scan("EMP")
  .project(builder.field("DEPTNO"), builder.field("ENAME"))
  .build();
System.out.println(RelOptUtil.toString(node));
{% endhighlight %}

and the output is

{% highlight text %}
LogicalProject(DEPTNO=[$7], ENAME=[$1])
  LogicalTableScan(table=[[scott, EMP]])
{% endhighlight %}

The two calls to `builder.field` create simple expressions
that return the fields from the input relational expression,
namely the TableScan created by the `scan` call.

Calcite has converted them to field references by ordinal,
`$7` and `$1`.

### Adding a Filter and Aggregate

A query with an Aggregate, and a Filter:

{% highlight java %}
final RelNode node = builder
  .scan("EMP")
  .aggregate(builder.groupKey("DEPTNO"),
      builder.count(false, "C"),
      builder.sum(false, "S", builder.field("SAL")))
  .filter(
      builder.call(SqlStdOperatorTable.GREATER_THAN,
          builder.field("C"),
          builder.literal(10)))
  .build();
System.out.println(RelOptUtil.toString(node));
{% endhighlight %}

is equivalent to SQL

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT deptno, count(*) AS c, sum(sal) AS s
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING count(*) > 10
{% endhighlight %}

and produces

{% highlight text %}
LogicalFilter(condition=[>($1, 10)])
  LogicalAggregate(group=[{7}], C=[COUNT()], S=[SUM($5)])
    LogicalTableScan(table=[[scott, EMP]])
{% endhighlight %}

### Push and pop

The builder uses a stack to store the relational expression produced by
one step and pass it as an input to the next step. This allows the
methods that produce relational expressions to produce a builder.

Most of the time, the only stack method you will use is `build()`, to get the
last relational expression, namely the root of the tree.

Sometimes the stack becomes so deeply nested it gets confusing. To keep things
straight, you can remove expressions from the stack. For example, here we are
building a bushy join:

{% highlight text %}
.
               join
             /      \
        join          join
      /      \      /      \
CUSTOMERS ORDERS LINE_ITEMS PRODUCTS
{% endhighlight %}

We build it in three stages. Store the intermediate results in variables
`left` and `right`, and use `push()` to put them back on the stack when it is
time to create the final `Join`:

{% highlight java %}
final RelNode left = builder
  .scan("CUSTOMERS")
  .scan("ORDERS")
  .join(JoinRelType.INNER, "ORDER_ID")
  .build();

final RelNode right = builder
  .scan("LINE_ITEMS")
  .scan("PRODUCTS")
  .join(JoinRelType.INNER, "PRODUCT_ID")
  .build();

final RelNode result = builder
  .push(left)
  .push(right)
  .join(JoinRelType.INNER, "ORDER_ID")
  .build();
{% endhighlight %}

### Switch Convention

The default RelBuilder creates logical RelNode without coventions. But you could
switch to use a different convention through `adoptConvention()`:

{% highlight java %}
final RelNode result = builder
  .push(input)
  .adoptConvention(EnumerableConvention.INSTANCE)
  .sort(toCollation)
  .build();
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, we create an EnumerableSort on top of the input RelNode.

### Field names and ordinals

You can reference a field by name or ordinal.

Ordinals are zero-based. Each operator guarantees the order in which its output
fields occur. For example, `Project` returns the fields generated by
each of the scalar expressions.

The field names of an operator are guaranteed to be unique, but sometimes that
means that the names are not exactly what you expect. For example, when you
join EMP to DEPT, one of the output fields will be called DEPTNO and another
will be called something like DEPTNO_1.

Some relational expression methods give you more control over field names:

* `project` lets you wrap expressions using `alias(expr, fieldName)`. It
  removes the wrapper but keeps the suggested name (as long as it is unique).
* `values(String[] fieldNames, Object... values)` accepts an array of field
  names. If any element of the array is null, the builder will generate a unique
  name.

If an expression projects an input field, or a cast of an input field, it will
use the name of that input field.

Once the unique field names have been assigned, the names are immutable.
If you have a particular `RelNode` instance, you can rely on the field names not
changing. In fact, the whole relational expression is immutable.

But if a relational expression has passed through several rewrite rules (see
[RelOptRule]({{ site.apiRoot }}/org/apache/calcite/plan/RelOptRule.html)), the field
names of the resulting expression might not look much like the originals.
At that point it is better to reference fields by ordinal.

When you are building a relational expression that accepts multiple inputs,
you need to build field references that take that into account. This occurs
most often when building join conditions.

Suppose you are building a join on EMP,
which has 8 fields [EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MGR, HIREDATE, SAL, COMM, DEPTNO]
and DEPT,
which has 3 fields [DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC].
Internally, Calcite represents those fields as offsets into
a combined input row with 11 fields: the first field of the left input is
field #0 (0-based, remember), and the first field of the right input is
field #8.

But through the builder API, you specify which field of which input.
To reference "SAL", internal field #5,
write `builder.field(2, 0, "SAL")`, `builder.field(2, "EMP", "SAL")`,
or `builder.field(2, 0, 5)`.
This means "the field #5 of input #0 of two inputs".
(Why does it need to know that there are two inputs? Because they are stored on
the stack; input #1 is at the top of the stack, and input #0 is below it.
If we did not tell the builder that were two inputs, it would not know how deep
to go for input #0.)

Similarly, to reference "DNAME", internal field #9 (8 + 1),
write `builder.field(2, 1, "DNAME")`, `builder.field(2, "DEPT", "DNAME")`,
or `builder.field(2, 1, 1)`.

### Recursive Queries

Warning: The current API is experimental and subject to change without notice.
A SQL recursive query, e.g. this one that generates the sequence 1, 2, 3, ...10:

{% highlight sql %}
WITH RECURSIVE aux(i) AS (
  VALUES (1)
  UNION ALL
  SELECT i+1 FROM aux WHERE i < 10
)
SELECT * FROM aux
{% endhighlight %}

can be generated using a scan on a TransientTable and a RepeatUnion:

{% highlight java %}
final RelNode node = builder
  .values(new String[] { "i" }, 1)
  .transientScan("aux")
  .filter(
      builder.call(
          SqlStdOperatorTable.LESS_THAN,
          builder.field(0),
          builder.literal(10)))
  .project(
      builder.call(
          SqlStdOperatorTable.PLUS,
          builder.field(0),
          builder.literal(1)))
  .repeatUnion("aux", true)
  .build();
System.out.println(RelOptUtil.toString(node));
{% endhighlight %}

which produces:

{% highlight text %}
LogicalRepeatUnion(all=[true])
  LogicalTableSpool(readType=[LAZY], writeType=[LAZY], tableName=[aux])
    LogicalValues(tuples=[[{ 1 }]])
  LogicalTableSpool(readType=[LAZY], writeType=[LAZY], tableName=[aux])
    LogicalProject($f0=[+($0, 1)])
      LogicalFilter(condition=[<($0, 10)])
        LogicalTableScan(table=[[aux]])
{% endhighlight %}

The builder methods perform various optimizations, including:

* `project` returns its input if asked to project all columns in order
* `filter` flattens the condition (so an `AND` and `OR` may have more than 2 children),
  simplifies (converting say `x = 1 AND TRUE` to `x = 1`)
* If you apply `sort` then `limit`, the effect is as if you had called `sortLimit`
